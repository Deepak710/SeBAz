<p align="justify">SeBAz is a tool to check your system's compliance with CIS Benchmarks. It automatically performs the tests and generates a CSV file for the auditor's review. It also generates an audit ready PDF document which contains information such as which tests passed (or) failed, and why so.</p>

## <img align="left" src="https://github.com/Deepak710/SeBAz/blob/master/Icon.png" width="45" height="45" alt=""/>Why SeBAz?
<p align="justify">Why must the <strong>auditor</strong> pick and choose systems to test for compliance when all systems can be checked for compliance with just one command!</p>

<p align="justify">Now get the score of <strong>ALL the systems</strong> in the organization, and review only those systems which have unusually low scores!</p>

<p align="justify">And if you are the <strong>system administrator</strong> in your organization, then this tool will help you find the system's score and what needs to be patched before your next audit!</p>
