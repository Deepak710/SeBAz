## What is SeBAz?
SeBAz is a tool to check your system's compliance with CIS Benchmarks. It automatically performs the tests and generates a CSV file for the auditor's review. It also generates an audit ready PDF document which contains information such as which tests passed (or) failed, and why so.

## Why SeBAz?
Why must the **auditor** pick and choose systems to test for compliance when all systems can be checked for compliance with just one command!

Now get the score of **ALL the systems** in the organization, and review only those systems which have unusually low scores!

And if you are the **system administrator** in your organization, then this tool will help you find the system's score and what needs to be patched before your next audit!

## Features
* Perform checks against CIS Benchmark recommendations
* Lists out all the recommendations
* **Plug and Play**
* Generate an **audit ready report** as to which controls passed or failed
* **Spreadsheet** with all the results, which can be modified after manually checking the systems
* Generate report(s) from the modified spreadsheets
* Logs of all the commands performed by the tool
